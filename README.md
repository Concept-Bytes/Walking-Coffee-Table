# Walking-Coffee-Table
 Arduino Bluetooth code for the walking coffee table. Includes two sketches: one for the joystick controller, which sends X/Y axis data via Bluetooth, and one for the table, which receives the signals and controls the motors. Use this code to wirelessly control the table's movement.
